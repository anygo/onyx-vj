
3.0.3: FEATURES

Changes:

- Addition of Windowing Buttons (click to open/close windows)
- Ability to save certain settings (blend mode order, window locations, filter orders, key mapping)
- All tempo filters can be turned on or off through a global setting (if they do not use tempo, they'll be timer based)
- Mix files can now save display background color and filters, as well as the xml format version
- Addition of new custom movies:
	- Layer copy -- copies another fully rendered layer
	- Loop Machine -- copies the display output for 10 seconds into a layer
- Addition of a memory consumption graph
- Addition of Midi Learn (not totally done)
- Addition of Tempo beats 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2, 1.  Can sync tempo to specific beats.
- Changed the random property in the FrameRND to off/start/end -- setting it to end makes the framerate smooth towards a new random time
- Display properties of saturation, threshold, contrast, and brightness can now be affected
- Control Arrays can now change and will be dispatched to the UI

Bug Fixes:

- Fixed a bug where pressing up or down (selecting filters) was crashing Onyx
- Fixed a bug where the visible property was not dispatching to the UI
- Fixed a bug where turning off the global tempo, and then adding a tempo filter, would re-start the tempo
- Fixed a bug where the loop start and end points were not dispatching changes to the UI
- Fixed a bug where tempo was getting out of sync after a little while
- Fixed a bug where the display window tabs were not clickable
- Fixed a bug where extra controls in filters / custom controls would not scroll correctly
- Fixed a bug where StateManager was returning class definitions, rather than the application state

API Changes:

- RenderManager changed to onyx.render.renderContent and onyx.render.renderFilters
- onyx.core.RenderTransform moved to onyx.render
- onyx.core.IRenderObject moved to onyx.render
- onyx.core.settings removed, variables now live in onyx.settings.*
- More performance tuning, bitmapdata.rect now changed to onyx.constants.BITMAP_RECT
- Addition of ControlPlugin (for filters, transitions, macros, visualizers)

Dev Notes:

- Onyx.displays moved to Display.displays
- Display._renderContent moved to DisplayRenderState (for future pausing of rendering)
- ApplicationState.initialize changes to no arguments
- Addition of ApplicationState.pause
- XML loading and saving moved to individual classes (controls.loadXML, filters.loadXML, etc)

Bugs:

- performance error by setting threshold > 0 and then contrast < 0.  Onyx Hangs (looks like a bad color matrix)
