Bugs:

- blendmode not dispatching when transition is being changed
- loading multiple layers at the same time not taking advantage of ContentManager
- need a way of saving plugin-types in .onx files (for visualizer)
- Colortransform bugged

X console not dispatching
X loading mixes bugged (layer 4 not dispatching)
X transitions not rendering
X layer move not rendering
X transitions and a tween erroring out (i think filters is not being dispatched)
	- add Blur, MoveScale

To Do:

- Display needs to dispatch spectrum events if needed (or should it just go through SpectrumAnalysis?

3.1.00:

X Visualizer plug-in type implemented
- Scratch pad plug-in type implemented
- Ability to add filters to global display
	- add global filters to .onx
- Rendering performance boost on layers that share a common movieclip or image
X Snap to Tempo implemented, filters can respond to tempo events
	- Addition of TempoFilter Class
- Ability to mute a filter

Development Notes:

- Rendering changed (once again), now types of IRenderObject, RenderStack, and RenderTransform
- Rendering no longer happens through a list of DisplayObjects, but rather all rendered into a single bitmap (this was done so global filters could be added to the display)


UI Changes
- Keys 1-6 now select layers
- Keys Q,W,E select pages within the layers
- FiltersWindow now has a seperate column for Bitmap Filters and Effect Filters
