3.1.00: FEATURES

X Visualizer plug-in type implemented
X Ability to add filters to global display
X Snap to Tempo implemented, filters can respond to tempo events
X Addition of TempoFilter Class
X Ability to mute a filter -- need to figure out a way to pause effects

STILL TO DO:
- Scratch pad plug-in type implemented
- add global filters to .onx
- Rendering performance boost on layers that share a common movieclip or image
- Controls can parent and change based on other controls

BUGS LEFT:

- blendmode not dispatching when transition is being changed
- loading multiple layers at the same time not taking advantage of ContentManager
- need a way of saving plugin-types in .onx files (for visualizer)

X console not dispatching
X loading mixes bugged (layer 4 not dispatching)
X transitions not rendering
X layer move not rendering
X transitions and a tween erroring out (i think filters is not being dispatched)
X Colortransform bugged

DEV NOTES:

- Rendering changed (once again), now types of IRenderObject, RenderStack, and RenderTransform
- Rendering no longer happens through a list of DisplayObjects, but rather all rendered into a single bitmap (this was done so global filters could be added to the display)
- Addition of a FileAdapter to handle different filesystems (getting ready for a local/m2 build), addition of HTTPAdapter
- Sped up UI a bit through ui.styles, removal of UIObject.highlight

UI CHANGES:
- Keys 1-6 now select layers
- Keys Q,W,E select pages within the layers
- FiltersWindow now has a seperate column for Bitmap Filters and Effect Filters
- Preview windows now display at real time
- Display window has been created, and you can drop filters onto the global display
